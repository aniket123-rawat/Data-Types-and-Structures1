Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval ?"],"metadata":{"id":"oqKtBQRzaV-w"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Ans - Historically, in Python versions prior to 3.7, dictionaries were considered unordered. This meant that the order in which items were inserted into the dictionary was not guaranteed to be preserved when iterating through it or accessing its elements. The internal hash table implementation determined the order, which could vary between Python versions or even between different runs of the same program.\n","\n","How this affected data retrieval (in older versions):\n","\n","No positional access: You could not rely on accessing elements by a numerical index like you can with lists or tuples. Data retrieval was solely based on the key.\n","Iteration order was unpredictable: If you iterated through the dictionary, the order in which you received the key-value pairs was not predictable and could change. This meant you couldn't rely on the order for any logic.\n","In Python 3.7 and later:\n","\n","Dictionaries now maintain insertion order. This means that the order in which you add key-value pairs to a dictionary is the order in which they will be retrieved when you iterate through the dictionary.\n","\n","How this affects data retrieval (in modern versions):\n","\n","While dictionaries now maintain insertion order, you still cannot access elements by numerical index like lists. Access is still done using the key.\n","Iteration through the dictionary will yield the key-value pairs in the order they were inserted.\n","So, while modern Python dictionaries remember the insertion order, the core principle of accessing data remains through the key, and they are not designed for positional access like lists.
